Building a social network that lets users recommend movies to friends. 
Currently it is a much simpler application that tracks an online phonebook. This lets me learn to build REST APIs, program a server with NodeJS and Express, state management with React hooks, server-side logic in JS ES7, and data management using noSQL and then slowly build out to a more complicated version.


Clone the GIT repository to your local machine and run the following command in your terminal to launch the web application on your localhost in developer mode: ``` npm run dev ```

Use an extension like Postman to send different types of request to the API at localhost:3001/api.
